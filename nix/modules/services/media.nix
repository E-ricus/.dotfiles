      # ── Auto-trust paired Bluetooth devices ──────────────────────────
      # BlueZ only auto-authorizes *incoming* profile connections from
      # devices marked Trusted. Pairing via bluetoothctl or a bar widget
      # (unlike GNOME/KDE, which set trust on pairing) leaves devices
      # untrusted. When such headphones initiate the reconnect themselves,
      # the incoming A2DP setup stalls waiting for agent authorization and
      # bluetoothd's own outgoing attempt collides with it. Failure
      # signature: "a2dp-sink profile connect failed ...: Device or
      # resource busy" in bluetoothd logs, and the PipeWire card stuck on
      # the off/audio-gateway profile with no sink to select.
      #
      # Trust is per-device state in /var/lib/bluetooth, so it cannot be
      # declared directly; instead, trust every already-paired device
      # (equivalent to what full DEs do). The timer re-runs the oneshot
      # periodically, so newly paired devices are trusted without a
      # reboot. (A path unit won't do: systemd path watches are not
      # recursive, and pairing writes to /var/lib/bluetooth/<adapter>/.)
